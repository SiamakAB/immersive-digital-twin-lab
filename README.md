<h2 align="center">IMMERSIVE DIGITAL TWIN LAB</h2>

🌐 *The Immersive Digital Twin Lab leverages cutting-edge XR (Extended Reality) technologies, AI, and cloud-based platforms to create fully interactive digital representations of water and environmental systems within the DIWA project. By integrating immersive visualization, real-time data streams, and AI-assisted analytics, stakeholders can explore, analyze, and interact with complex infrastructures in ways that were previously impossible. XR-enabled digital twins facilitate collaborative decision-making, scenario testing, and predictive modeling, allowing project partners, researchers, and policymakers to better understand environmental processes, optimize resource management, and co-create innovative solutions. This approach not only enhances transparency and engagement but also accelerates the translation of data into actionable insights for sustainable water and environmental management.*

<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

The **Immersive Digital Twin Lab** is established at the **University of Oulu**, within the **Department of Technology** and **WE3 Unit**, as part of the **Digital Waters Flagship** program. The lab focuses on virtualising digital twins and making them accessible through **immersive XR-based experiences**, supporting stakeholder collaboration and co-creation of services.

*Our mission is to enable scalable, interoperable, and collaborative digital twin experiences through open-source technologies, cloud platforms, XR interfaces, and data-driven workflows.*


<h2 align="center">Core Objectives</h2>

### Virtualising Digital Twins for immersive experiences
- Transform digital twins from technical models into interactive, human-centered platforms  
- Integrate XR (AR/VR/MR) for real-time visualization and interaction  
- Support collaborative decision-making and stakeholder engagement  

### Enable interoperable and scalable digital solutions
- Build cloud-based, modular architectures  
- Integrate IoT and sensor networks with real-time simulation pipelines  
- Promote **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles  
- Foster collaboration across disciplines — from architecture, engineering, and construction to urban planning  

<h2 align="center">Organizational Structure</h2>

*The lab operates primarily under **RT4: Digital Services, Platforms, and Business Applications**, in collaboration with other research themes (RT4: Digital services, platforms, and business applications | Interoperable digital solutions for sharing and exploring data, and co-creation of services)*


<p align="center">XR Services</h2>

| XR Service | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [DT Integration](docs/xr-roadmap.md#dt-integration) | *Connect VR app to DIWA Digital Twin backend for synchronized model & sensor data.* |
| [WebGIS Interop](docs/xr-roadmap.md#webgis-interop) | *Seamless integration with ArcGIS Pro, Enterprise, and Online; 2D dashboards ↔ 3D immersive exploration.* |
| [3D Sim & Design](docs/xr-roadmap.md#3d-sim-design) | *Immersive VR environments in Unity, Cesium, and ArcGIS SDKs for city-scale hydrological & spatial simulations.* |
| [Collaborative VR](docs/xr-activities.md#collaborative-vr) | *Multi-user VR sessions for co-exploration, participatory planning, and stakeholder engagement.* |
| [AI Assistant](docs/xr-activities.md#ai-assistant) | *Generative AI assistants for natural-language queries, scenario explanations, and interactive model exploration.* |

*The Immersive Digital Twin Lab leverages these XR services to demonstrate and explore supersites and real-world use cases. XR demonstrations will initially be conducted in **VR environments** (3DoF, 6DoF, tabletop, 1:1 scale) to provide fully immersive, interactive experiences. Subsequently, these experiences will be extended to **Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR) devices**, enabling multi-scale visualization, collaborative exploration, and stakeholder engagement across diverse digital twin scenarios.*
