*This document outlines recommended long-term goals and objectives for XR integration within the DIWA Flagship. It is intended as a draft for discussion and may be refined over time.*  

## Table – Recommended XR Long-Term Goals and Objectives

| Goal | Objectives | Expected Outcomes |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1. Establish a Leading XR Research and Development Hub | 1.1 Develop state-of-the-art Immersive Digital Twin Lab at the University of Oulu, including VR/MR/XR infrastructure and digital twin platforms.<br>1.2 Build a skilled team of XR researchers, developers, and students.<br>1.3 Publish high-impact research papers, technical reports, and case studies in XR and digital twin applications. | *Fully equipped XR lab; skilled personnel; increased visibility through publications. Infrastructure and hiring ongoing.* |
| 2. Promote XR-Based Innovation and Solutions for Water & Environmental Data Services | 2.1 Develop XR-enabled user interfaces for DIWA-DS datasets, including immersive 3D visualizations.<br>2.2 Co-create XR services with stakeholders for real-time decision-making, monitoring, and predictive analytics.<br>2.3 Demonstrate XR applications in pilot supersites and real-world scenarios using the Immersive Digital Twin Lab. | *Enhanced usability of DIWA data; real-time stakeholder engagement; annual supersite demos. Continuous co-creation with partners.* |
| 3. Strengthen National and International XR Collaboration Networks | 3.1 Partner with other XR labs, research centers, and industry players for joint projects and knowledge exchange.<br>3.2 Participate in international XR events, conferences, and collaborative initiatives (XR4EUROPE 2026, Slush 2026, UnitedXR Europe, EGU Vienna 2026).<br>3.3 Organize and participate in biannual DIWA XR/Water meetings (Helsinki, Turku) and workshops.<br>3.4 Establish joint workshops, co-development programs, and networking events. | *Broadened collaboration networks; access to global XR expertise; joint research and development initiatives.
