## Overview
The **Immersive Digital Twin Lab** is established at the **University of Oulu**, within the **Department of Technology** and **WE3 Unit**, as part of the **Digital Waters Flagship** program. The lab focuses on **virtualising digital twins** and making them accessible through **immersive XR-based experiences**, supporting stakeholder collaboration and co-creation of services.

Our mission is to enable **scalable, interoperable, and collaborative digital twin experiences** through **open-source technologies**, **cloud platforms**, **XR interfaces**, and **data-driven workflows**.

## Core Objectives

1. **Virtualising Digital Twins for immersive experiences**
   - Transform digital twins from technical models into interactive, human-centered platforms
   - Integrate XR (AR/VR/MR) for real-time visualization and interaction
   - Support collaborative decision-making and stakeholder engagement

2. **Enable interoperable and scalable digital solutions**
   - Build cloud-based, modular architectures
   - Integrate IoT and sensor networks with real-time simulation pipelines
   - Promote **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles
   - Foster collaboration across disciplines — from architecture, engineering, and construction to urban planning

## Organizational Structure
The lab operates primarily under **RT4: Digital Services, Platforms, and Business Applications**, in collaboration with other research themes.

| RT4: Digital services, platforms, and business applications | Interoperable digital solutions for sharing and exploring data, and co-creation of services |

### XR Services

| XR Service | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| DT Integration | Connect VR app to DIWA Digital Twin backend for synchronized model & sensor data. |
| WebGIS Interop | Seamless integration with ArcGIS Pro, Enterprise, and Online; 2D dashboards ↔ 3D immersive exploration. |
| 3D Sim & Design | Immersive VR environments in Unity, Cesium, and ArcGIS SDKs for city-scale hydrological & spatial simulations. |
| Collaborative VR | Multi-user VR sessions for co-exploration, participatory planning, and stakeholder engagement. |
| AI Assistant | Generative AI assistants for natural-language queries, scenario explanations, and interactive model exploration. |

*The Immersive Digital Twin Lab leverages these XR services to demonstrate and explore supersites and real-world use cases. XR demonstrations will initially be conducted in **VR environments** (3DoF, 6DoF, tabletop, 1:1 scale) to provide fully immersive, interactive experiences. Subsequently, these experiences will be extended to **Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR) devices**, enabling multi-scale visualization, collaborative exploration, and stakeholder engagement across diverse digital twin scenarios.*

| RT5: Stakeholder Collaboration | Methods and platforms for collaborative design, immersive co-creation, and multi-user interaction |
| Training & Capacity Building | Workshops, tutorials, and hands-on sessions to train students and researchers in XR and digital twin technologies |
